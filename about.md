## About

This is both a topics and skills course.  The topics relate to determinants of
human well-being over the short and long-run, with a focus on the role of
environmental factors in shaping development outcomes.  The skills relate to
gaining facility with main methods that underlie quantitative research in the
environmental social sciences, including econometric concepts related to causal
inference, data wrangling skills, and data visualization.  Assignments and
class time will also be aimed at practicing critical components of the research
pipeline that are often not taught, including how to come up with a good
research question, how to effectively frame your research findings, and how to
make more compelling visualizations of your results.  Students will get the
most out of the course if they arrive with a working knowledge of R (or
comparable programming environment) and some previous exposure to econometric
methods or upper-level statistics related to causal inference. 


The course has the following learning goals:
 - Knowledge and literacy on the ``big questions" at the intersection of
   environment and development
 - Facility with the main methods that underlie quantitative work in the
   environmental social sciences, including a working understanding of the key
   methods for causal inference in observational data, the ability to process
   spatial data, and the ability to implement foundational econometric
   techniques and interpret the results.
 - An improved ability to navigate the research production pipeline -- i.e. to
   execute the skills needed to generate a paper that other people want to
   read, and that you can get published.  This includes the ability to generate
   research ideas (many of them bad), to wrangle data, to conduct analysis, to
   make nice figures, and to frame your results in a broad and interesting way

## Assignments

We will have three different assignments for each week: a paper reading, a data
visualization task, and a problem set. We will distribute the assignments on this webpage,
